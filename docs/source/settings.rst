Settings
========

The settings can be accessed from the settings tab inside the :ref:`sidebar`.

Resolution
----------

Sets the rendering resolution of the scene. By default it's adjusted to fix the
browser window, but a fixed one can also be specified. This is especially
useful for creating screenshots and recordings.

The scene gets scaled accordingly to fit the browser if a fixed resolution is
provided. While the aspect ratio is preserved, it might look zoomed in or out.

.. warning::
    Recordings with high resolution might lead to frame drops depending on your
    hardware.

Recordings
----------

Here you can only specify the framerate of the recordings.

Stage
-----

Loads a stage into the scene or removes the current. Also shows the download
progress if one was provided via url parameters.
